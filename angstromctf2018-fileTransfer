# File transfer
We get a pcap which we open in WireShark. It comprises only 28 packets from only two different hosts - so this challenge should not be too difficult. Usually we would first navigate through the TCP streams via right-click on a TCP packet -> '''Follow''' -> '''TCP Stream''' to get an idea of what is (roughly) going on. Here we only need to scroll a little to see that a JPEG picture has been transferred (see screenshot below, grey row).

We probably could extract the picture manually, but WireShark already comes with the exact feature required here. Navigate to File -> Export Objects and select the only file available. Save it somewhere as .JPEG and enjoy the flag!
